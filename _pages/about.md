I am an Undergraduate student majoring in physics with a minor in math. My primary research interests are Quantum Computing and Quantum Information Theory. I am also interested in working in the domains of Quantum Machine Learning, Scientific Machine learning and other interdisciplinary domains. I am equipped with strong programming skills working with Python, C++, Julia and MATLAB . I have previous experience in machine learning projects particularly in the Deep learning domain. I have done various projects using time-series datasets and analyzing the data using standard Data science and ML Techniques. I am currently working on Scientific Machine learning projects using Julia Programming language.
